# QHEOM
This repository contains the code for the quantum circuit simulation with the QHEOM manuscript.

It reads propagators from hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) simulations of energy and charge transfer dynamics in molecular systems and then constructs quantum circuits based on SVD dilation. 
The diagonal unitary operator is implemented using a Walsh series representation. 

This code demonstrates dynamical simulations for charge transfer in the carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 (CPC60) molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and energy transfer dynamics in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex.
