# QHEOM
This repository provides the code for the Quantum circuit simulation with QHEOM manuscript.
In particular, it read the propagators from HEOM simulation for energy and charge transfer dynamics in molecular systems.
After read the propagators, we construct the quantum circuit with SVD dilation, with the Diagonal Unitary Operator is Implemented using Walsh Series representation. 
Here, the dynamical simulations of the charge transfer in carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 (CPC60) molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and the energy transfer dynamics in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex is presented.
